# Introduction

[@beerush/utils](https://github.com/beerush-id/utils) is a TypeScript utility library designed for internal use at Beerush, but it's also available for external use.

The library provides a collection of utility functions that help improve development efficiency and reduce repetitive code. It's organized into three main modules:

- [Client](/api/client/): Client-side utilities for DOM manipulation, styling, forms, files, clipboard operations, and more
- [Global](/api/global/): Universal utilities for working with strings, numbers, objects, colors, logging, and other base types
- [Server](/api/server/): Server-side utility functions

## Key Features

- **TypeScript Support**: Written in TypeScript with full type definitions
- **Modular Design**: Import only what you need with tree-shakable modules
- **Multiple Module Formats**: Supports both ESM and CommonJS module formats
- **Well Tested**: Comprehensive test coverage for reliability
- **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead with focused functionality
